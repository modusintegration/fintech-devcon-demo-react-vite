## Purpose
The purpose of this demo is to show how PortX deploys an SSO app with our Stack (Github/AWS/ArgoCD/Grafana).
This UI is interacting with both mambu and cis cores.
In the UI you will be able to send money back and forth.

## API Docs
https://workshop.dev.custom.demos.tenant-1.portx.io/portx-openbanking-docs/

Note these are the full api specs and our demo supports `/accounts` and `/persons`

## Auth
For Auth we are using PortX IAM which using Keycloak. There are 2 roles configured for this demo
`admin` and `operator`. Internally we used `admin`, which is used for creating persons and accounts. Everyone will 
have access to `operator`, the credentials have been hardcoded in
this demo UI, and you can also find the credentials in the postman collection.

## Postman Collection
Here is a collection of calls you can make to our demo api, 
Note: You will need a CliendID and Secret to get an auth token, .
